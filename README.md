# CarND-Controls-MPC
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

## Introduction
In this project I've implemented the Model Predictive Control to drive the car around the track. Calculated the cross track error through code and additionally, there's a 100 millisecond latency between actuations commands on top of the connection latency.Also used 70 as the reference velocity.

This solution makes use of the IPOPT and CPPAD libraries to calculate an optimal trajectory and its associated actuation commands in order to minimize error with a third-degree polynomial fit to the given waypoints. The optimization considers only a short duration's worth of waypoints, and produces a trajectory for that duration based upon a model of the vehicle's kinematics and a cost function based mostly on the vehicle's cross-track error and orientation angle error, with other cost factors included to improve performance. Used solver to reduce the cost function using initial state, model, cost function and constraints to determine the vector of control inputs so as to minimise the cost function.

For example, if we were to set N to 100, the simulation would run much slower. This is because the solver would have to optimize 4 times as many control inputs. Ipopt, the solver, permutes the control input values until it finds the lowest cost. If you were to open up Ipopt and plot the x and y values as the solver mutates them, the plot would look like a worm moving around trying to fit the shape of the reference trajectory.

Note: The yellow is a polynomial fitted to waypoints and the green line represents the x and y coordinates of the MPC trajectory.

## Ipopt
Ipopt is the tool we'll be using to optimize the control inputs [δ1,a1,...,δN−1,aN−1]. It's able to find locally optimal values (non-linear problem!) while keeping the constraints set directly to the actuators and the constraints defined by the vehicle model. Ipopt requires we give it the jacobians and hessians directly - it does not compute them for us. Hence, we need to either manually compute them or have a library do this for us. Luckily, there is a library called CppAD which does exactly this.
## CppAD
CppAD is a library we'll use for automatic differentiation. By using CppAD we don't have to manually compute derivatives, which is tedious and prone to error.

In order to use CppAD effectively, we have to use its types instead of regular double or std::vector types.

## Experiment
- **Timestep Length and Elapsed Duration (N & dt)**
The values chosen for N and dt are 10 and 0.1, respectively. This is as per the suggestion of Udacity's provided office hours for the project. These values mean that the optimizer is considering a one-second duration in which to determine a corrective trajectory.

Polynomial Fitting and MPC Preprocessing: A polynomial is fitted to waypoints. If the student preprocesses waypoints, the vehicle state, and/or actuators prior to the MPC procedure it is described.

The waypoints are preprocessed by transforming them to the vehicle's perspective. This simplifies the process to fit a polynomial to the waypoints because the vehicle's x and y coordinates are now at the origin (0, 0) and the orientation angle is also zero.


## Additional Cost
- **Model Predictive Control with 100 ms Latency**
The original kinematic equations depend upon the actuations from the previous timestep, but with a delay of 100ms (which happens to be the timestep interval) the actuations are applied another timestep later, so the equations have been altered to account for this. 
In addition to the cost functions suggested in the lessons ( CTE, epsi, delta between velocity and a reference velocity, delta, acceleration change) an additional cost penalizing the combination of velocity and delta has been included.

 ## Implementation Details
 The kinematic model includes the vehicle's x and y coordinates, orientation angle (psi), and velocity, as well as the cross-track error and psi error (epsi). Actuator outputs are acceleration and delta (steering angle). The model combines the state and actuations from the previous timestep with the current so that it can calculate the state for the current timestep based on mentioned equations.

### Calculating the cross track and orientation error

- **fit a polynomial to the above x and y coordinates**
auto coeffs = polyfit(ptsx, ptsy, 1);
The x and y coordinates are contained in the ptsx and ptsy vectors. Since these are 2-element vectors a 1-degree polynomial (straight line) is sufficient.

- **The cross track error is calculated by evaluating at polynomial at x (-1) and subtracting y**

Recall orientation error is calculated as follows eψ=ψ−ψdes, where ψdes is can be calculated as 
arctan(f​′(x)).

f(x)=a0 + a1∗x
f​′(x)=a1
​​hence the solution double epsi = psi - atan(coeffs[1]);

       Listening to port 4567
       Connected!!!
       mpc(4561,0x7ffff1eed3c0) malloc: *** error for object 0x7f911e007600: incorrect checksum for freed object
       - object was probably modified after being freed.
       *** set a breakpoint in malloc_error_break to debug

## Basic Build Instructions


1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./mpc`.

## Tips

1. It's recommended to test the MPC on basic examples to see if your implementation behaves as desired. One possible example
is the vehicle starting offset of a straight line (reference). If the MPC implementation is correct, after some number of timesteps
(not too many) it should find and track the reference line.
2. The `lake_track_waypoints.csv` file has the waypoints of the lake track. You could use this to fit polynomials and points and see of how well your model tracks curve. NOTE: This file might be not completely in sync with the simulator so your solution should NOT depend on it.
3. For visualization this C++ [matplotlib wrapper](https://github.com/lava/matplotlib-cpp) could be helpful.)
4.  Tips for setting up your environment are available [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/23d376c7-0195-4276-bdf0-e02f1f3c665d)

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/b1ff3be0-c904-438e-aad3-2b5379f0e0c3/concepts/1a2255a0-e23c-44cf-8d41-39b8a3c8264a)
for instructions and the project rubric.

## Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to we ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
